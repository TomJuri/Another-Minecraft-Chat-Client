AMCC is a GUI application that lets you join a Minecraft server and chat freely without opening your Minecraft game.

## Main features
* :book: Complete GUI with Minecraft styled server list, in-game player list with skins and a tabbed pane allowing you to chat on multiple clients.
* :art: Minecraft style UI elements, such as chat font (Minecraftia), configurable buttons and text fields.
* :clipboard: Tray support.
* :gear: My own lightweight implementation of Minecraft protocol, supporting versions 1.8 to 1.16.5.

## My goals
This project is my take on implementing Minecraft's protocol from scratch.<br>
It started as a simple command line chat client and was quickly wrapped in a GUI.<br>
Now my primary goal is to implement as many features from Minecraft's original protocol as I can
without using any other third-party libraries.
