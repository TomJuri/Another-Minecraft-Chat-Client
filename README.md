AMCC is a GUI application that lets you join a Minecraft server and chat freely without opening your game.

## Main features
* 📖 Complete GUI with Minecraft styled server list, in-game player list with skins and a tabbed pane allowing you to chat on multiple clients.
* 🎨 Minecraft style UI elements, such as chat font (Minecraftia), configurable buttons and text fields.
* 📋 Tray support.
* ⚙️ My own lightweight implementation of Minecraft protocol, supporting versions 1.8 to 1.19.2.
* 📦 Basic inventory handling and item using.
* ⏰ Automatic messages and responses, perfect for AFKing.
* :electric_plug: Easily extensible via plugins!

## 📙 My goals
This project is my take on implementing Minecraft's protocol from scratch.<br>
It started as a simple command line chat client and was quickly wrapped in a GUI.<br>
Now my main goal is to implement as many features from Minecraft's original protocol as I can
without using any other third-party libraries.
