# üìô My goals
This project is my take on implementing Minecraft's protocol from scratch.<br>
It started as a simple command line chat client and was quickly wrapped in a GUI.<br>
Now my main goal is to implement as many features from Minecraft's original protocol as I can
without using any other third-party libraries.
